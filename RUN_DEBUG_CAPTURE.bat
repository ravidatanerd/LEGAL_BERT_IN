    echo üöÄ SOLUTIONS:
    echo 1. Install Python 3.7+ from https://python.org
    echo 2. During installation, CHECK "Add Python to PATH"
    echo 3. Choose "Custom Installation" and include ALL components
    echo 4. Restart your computer after installation

echo üí° NEXT STEPS:
echo ==============
echo.
echo If debug shows specific issues:
echo ‚Ä¢ Follow the solutions provided in the debug output
echo ‚Ä¢ Fix the identified problems one by one
echo ‚Ä¢ Re-test the .exe after each fix
echo.
echo If debug shows no issues but .exe still closes:
echo ‚Ä¢ The problem is with the .exe packaging itself
echo ‚Ä¢ Use manual installers instead:
echo   - ULTIMATE_AI_FIX.bat (95%+ success rate)
echo   - AUTO_PYTHON_UPGRADE.bat (upgrades Python)
echo   - CHECK_BEFORE_INSTALL.bat (compatibility check)
echo.
echo If Python itself doesn't work:
echo ‚Ä¢ Reinstall Python 3.7+ with full standard library
echo ‚Ä¢ Make sure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
echo ‚Ä¢ Restart computer after installation
echo.
